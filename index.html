            “When you show yourself to the world and display your talents, you naturally stir all kinds of resentment,
            envy, and other manifestations of insecurity… you cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings
            of others”

        <summary><cite>Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones</cite> by James
            Clear</summary>
        <p>
            Changing habits doesn't come over night so that's why it's time to employ Clear's advice and learn how to
            make small changes in life to reap the benefits. From simple life hacks, such as the Two Minute Rule, to
            exploring the field of neuroscience, this is a brilliant book to find out more about how to press 'restart'
            on your life.

            “It’s fear that keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not paying the bills, the fear of being
            fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over. That’s the price of studying to
            learn a profession or trade, and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money – and then get
            angry with their boss.”
